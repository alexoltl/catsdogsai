# catsdogsai
AI model which can differenciate images of cats and images of dogs

Run the main.py file to generate the .h5 file which you can use the in the `example.py` file. 
Note that you will need a dataset of images for the AI to learn from. The one I used was the [Kaggle Dogs and Cats dataset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765) but you can use which ever one you see fit, you just need to change some code in the `mian.py` to accept those files properly.

(if you decide to use the Kaggle database, delete image #666 and 11702, they are corrupted)
